# Handwritten DIGITalization
To realize the recognition of handwritten numbers in our daily life by artificial intelligence in efforts to save time and labor cost. We aim at developing an algorithm with actual verification that targets at 99% recognition accuracy. Our approach in training our algorithm more, we believe that these are effective artificial intelligence recognition methods.  

We used TensorFlow, an open-source software library and ‘MNIST’ data set adapted from URL https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist.   

## Getting Started
To clone this project makesure you already have `git` installed.
